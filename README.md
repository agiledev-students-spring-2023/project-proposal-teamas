### Project title

100Days 

### What and why?

The 100-day practice is an Instagram challenge in which participants posted a daily photo of their work for 100 days through the #100daysofpractice on Instagram. The daily work didn't need to be polished or completed as the purpose of the challenge was to offer the opportunity to pursue a creative passion and develop or refine a skill over a period of a 100 days. We participated last year and discovered that the biggest challenge was declining motivation and inspiration for ideas over a period of time. To address this, we aim to create a mobile platform specifically for 100-day participants. The 100-day app will have three main features: daily tracking/reminders for posting, a network for sharing among all users, and a system for support and motivation based on user performance.


### For whom?

The App is mainly for 100days participants who found themselves in need of extra support, motivation and a connective community. 


### How?
* User creates an account and chooses the category of the practice of their choice (eg. music, drawing, crafting...)
* User sets when the daily practice is, whether to be reminded to practice, and the frequency of reminders.
* User uploads images or videos of their work with a description. 
* User can browse other users' work, and have the option to leave comments and possible prompts. User can also follow the users they like. 
* Based on user's performance, the system will provide periodic reflection (eg. how do you feel about the practice, what do you like or dislike, what is your favorite date of practice...etc)
 

### Scope
* Interface: log in page, upload page, friend page, calendar/reminder page, content browsing page
* Database of user account and user content
* Image/Video upload system
* Content sharing and browsing system
* Calender and reminder system 
* Following/follower system
