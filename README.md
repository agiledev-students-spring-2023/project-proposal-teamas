### Project title

100Days 

### What and why?

The 100-day practice is a instagram challenge in which participants posted a daily photo of their work for 100 days through the #100daysofpractice on Ins.The dailyh work didn't need to be polished or completed as the challenge means to offers the opportunity to pursue a creative passion and develop or refine a skill over a 100-day period. we participated last year and found the biggest challenge was decreasing motivation and ideas over period of time. To address this, We aim to create a mobile platform specifically for 100-day participants. The 100-day app will have three main features: daily tracking/reminders for posting, a network for sharing among all users, and a system for support and motivation based on user performance.


### For whom?

The App is mainly for 100days participants who found themselves in need of extra support,motivation and a connective community. 


### How?
* User create account and choose a category of their practice(music, drawing, crafting...)
* User set when the daily practice time, wether to be reminded and the frequency of reminder
* User upload image or video of their work with description 
* User can browse other account' works, leaving comment and possible prompts. User can also follow the account they like. 
* Based on user's performance, system will provide periodic reflection(eg.how do you feel about the practice, what do you like or dislike, what is your favorite date of practice...etc)
 

### Scope
* Interface: Log in page, upload page, friend page, calendar/reminder page, content browsing page
* Database of user account and user content
* Image/Video upload system
* Content sharing and browsing system
* Calender and reminder system
